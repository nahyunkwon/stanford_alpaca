0,space,Which everyday objects can be inaccessible in this indoor space?,space: bathroom,"Typicall in bathrooms, slippery floors after the shower can cause tripping hazard, especially for the elderly and children. Door knobs can be hard to operate for people, especially when they have motor disabilities on hands or arms. Moisturizer bottles with a push tab requires fine motor skills, such as gripping and pushing with a hand or a finger, can present challenges.",FALSE
1,object_context,How this object can be inaccessible in this context?,"object: toothpaste, context: hand injury","When one's hand is injured, toothpastes can be very difficult to open/close the cap, and squeeze. One common solution can be using a squeezer or a pump dispenser. You can easily get a toothpaste squeezer from the market, or 3D print it by finding the design in Thingiverse. This can be one example augmentation design: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1261318",FALSE
2,contexts_for_space,In which contexts this space can be inaccessible?,space: bathroom,"Bathrooms can be inaccessible in multiple contexts. 1. For people with visual impairments, objects in bathrooms can be hard to locate. 2. Young kids or babies can get injured by turning on hot water by mistake. 3. If there is no grab bars near the toilet and bathtub, it will be hard to use for people with wheelchairs.",FALSE
3,contexts_for_object,In which contexts this object can be inaccessible?,object: door knob,"Door knobs can be inaccessible in multiple contexts. 1. Door knobs can be hard to operate for people who have limb injury. For example, if people are wearing a cast on hands, hard gripping and rotation can be very difficult. 2. Door knobs can be hard to reach for people with height challenges, such as young kids, people with dwarfism, and wheelchair users. 3. In situations of scarce lighting, such as blackout, door knobs can be hard to locate. 4. Parents with young kids might want to add restrictions to certain rooms and block the access by locking the door knobs for safety issues.",FALSE
4,object_type,"What are the types of this object, and what are the unique accessibility challenges?",object: door knob,"In general, door knobs can present motor challenges, including operation reach issues. 1. round door knob: round door knobs requires hard gripping and rotation, which pose challenges to people with less gripping power and motor freedom on their hands and arms. Since round door knobs do not allow alternative operation with arms, this type of door knobs present more challenges than other types of door knobs. 2. lever door knob: lever door knobs require less gripping power and allow alternative operation using arms. However, metal levers can be slippery and not long enough to aid altermative operation with arms. ",FALSE
5,solutions_general,How can I improve this object's accessibility challenges? ,object: door knob,"To aid accessibility challenges of door knobs, there could be different solutions per types or contexts that present challenges. 1. If it's round door knob, it can be difficult to use for people with hand injury. Attaching an additional lever can address motor challenges. 2. If it's a lever door knob, you might want to add an arm-actuable attachment, so that person can hook their arm on the attachment and pull the door more easily. 3. You might put some glow-in-the-dark stickers on the door knob, so that it can be more noticeable at night. 4. You might want to add a lock especially when you have young kids, to limit their access to the garage or storage, for safety issues. ",FALSE
6,solutions_context,What are the solutions for this object under this context?,"object: door knob, context: I am wearing a cast on my wrist.","If you are wearing a cast on your wrist, door knobs become inaccessible due to your limited motor ability on hands and arms. It's better to use a lever extension or arm extension so that the door knob is operable without fine motor skills. ",FALSE
7,solutions_condition,"Instead of getting a total replacement which is costly, are there augmentations for this object to make it accessible? ",object: round door knob,"If you don't want a total replacement, adding an augmentation to the existing round door knob could be a solution. For example, you might attach a wooden stick by using a duct tape to the knob. Or you can 3D print a attachable door knob lever, such as this design: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1095439",FALSE
