Third, it can lead to loss of economic, cultural, and individual opportunities, as people with disabilities are not able to participate in activities or experiences. Fourth, it can lead to increased incidents of loneliness, depression, and other mental health issues, as people with disabilities may have difficulty connecting with others and feeling included.
